1. Understanding the problem
    Ask Questions
        What happens when you first start the game?
            Player is standing in starting room asking for player input on which direction to go (with only optional directions)
        What are the rules/flow of the game?
            Player can move from room to room.
            The rooms are pre-designed with a direction connected (north, south, east, and west)
        How many players will there be?
            1
        How many rooms will there be?
            5
        How will the players move in the rooms?
            They won't, they will either be in or out of the room.
        How will the players move between rooms?
            Using the directional input of [n]orth, [s]outh, [e]ast, and [w]est
            use repl - read, eval, print, loop
            player will give input by giving the char representing the direction to go in
        What will be the size of the rooms? Will the size be a range?
            no size, or range, they are atomic
        Will the rooms have obsticles/walls?
            no
        Do I have to worry about any existing universe outside of the rooms?
            no, however if the player selects a direction not optional, give error "you cannot move in that direction"
        Is there a limit of items a player and rooms can carry?
            rooms can have 1-3 times
            player can carry up to 5 items
        How will the players execute commands of get and drop? What triggers these commands to appear?
            ## use two word verb and object (take item)
            show list of available items from room upon entry
            loop through items and give player option to get or drop items
            if player inventory is full, ask player if they would like to drop item in inventory
                if player says yes
                    show inventory, and exit once player selects and drops/uses item
                else
                    drop item and move into next item
        Will there be monsters in the mvp, if so, how should I handle this?
            no
        How will the player access the inventory?
            by inputting i at any point in the game or
                selecting yes when the game asks for it
        What will the inventory look like?
            a simple list of items (1. itemName, 2. itemName, 3. itemName)
            followed by a message: "please input number to select item or input e to [e]xit:"
                if user inputs number of item:
                    display message saying "[u]se, [d]rop, [b]ack, or [e]xit:"
                        Hint: both use/drop will make the item disappear, no functionality written yet for using the item.
                        [b]ack - takes you to the previous item select menu
                        [e]xit - exits inventory
        Is there a menu to execute commands, what does it look like, how and when can the player access it?
            yes - it will have a basic string instruction for every console input.

2. Devise a Plan
    Wednesday:
        * build start game (main loop)
        * Build rooms
        * Build player
        * Allow player to move between rooms
        * build end game
    Thursday:
        Build Item Objects
        Build inventory object
        Add items to rooms
        Add ability for player to carry items in inventory
        Add ability for get/drop items (for rooms and players)
